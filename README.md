Meta Token (MTA)
Meta Token (MTA) is a basic ERC20-like token implemented on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity. This contract allows minting and burning of tokens.

Contract Details
Token Name: META
Token Symbol: MTA

Public Variables
tokenName: Name of the token ("META").
tokenAbbrv: Token abbreviation or symbol ("MTA").
totalSupply: Total supply of tokens in circulation.

Functions
mint(address _address, uint _value)
Mints _value amount of tokens and assigns them to _address.

Parameters:
_address: Address to which the minted tokens will be assigned.
_value: Amount of tokens to mint.
burn(address _address, uint _value)
Burns _value amount of tokens from _address.

Parameters:
_address: Address from which tokens will be burned.
_value: Amount of tokens to burn.

Events
Mint: Fired when tokens are minted.
Mint(address indexed to, uint value)
Burn: Fired when tokens are burned.
Burn(address indexed from, uint value)

Usage
Deployment:
Deploy the contract on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity version 0.8.0 or higher.
Interacting with the Contract:
Use the mint function to create new tokens and assign them to addresses.
Use the burn function to destroy tokens from addresses.
Example
// Example usage of the contract
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ExampleUsage {

    MyToken public metaToken;

    constructor(address _metaTokenAddress) {
        metaToken = MyToken(_metaTokenAddress);
    }

    function mintTokens(address _receiver, uint _amount) external {
        metaToken.mint(_receiver, _amount);
        // Additional logic after minting...
    }

    function burnTokens(address _holder, uint _amount) external {
        metaToken.burn(_holder, _amount);
        // Additional logic after burning...
    }
}
Notes
This contract is a basic implementation and may need additional features and security enhancements for production use.
Always ensure to thoroughly test and audit smart contracts before deploying them in a production environment.

# Meta Token (MTA)

Meta Token (MTA) is a basic ERC20-like token implemented on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity. This contract allows minting and burning of tokens.

## Contract Details

- **Token Name:** META
- **Token Symbol:** MTA

### Public Variables

- `tokenName`: Name of the token ("META").
- `tokenAbbrv`: Token abbreviation or symbol ("MTA").
- `totalSupply`: Total supply of tokens in circulation.

### Functions

#### `mint(address _address, uint _value)`

Mints `_value` amount of tokens and assigns them to `_address`.

- **Parameters:**
  - `_address`: Address to which the minted tokens will be assigned.
  - `_value`: Amount of tokens to mint.

#### `burn(address _address, uint _value)`

Burns `_value` amount of tokens from `_address`.

- **Parameters:**
  - `_address`: Address from which tokens will be burned.
  - `_value`: Amount of tokens to burn.

### Events

- **Mint:** Fired when tokens are minted.
  - `Mint(address indexed to, uint value)`

- **Burn:** Fired when tokens are burned.
  - `Burn(address indexed from, uint value)`

### Usage

1. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the contract on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity version 0.8.0 or higher.

2. **Interacting with the Contract:**
   - Use the `mint` function to create new tokens and assign them to addresses.
   - Use the `burn` function to destroy tokens from addresses.

 Example

```solidity
// Example usage of the contract
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ExampleUsage {

    MyToken public metaToken;

    constructor(address _metaTokenAddress) {
        metaToken = MyToken(_metaTokenAddress);
    }

    function mintTokens(address _receiver, uint _amount) external {
        metaToken.mint(_receiver, _amount);
        // Additional logic after minting...
    }

    function burnTokens(address _holder, uint _amount) external {
        metaToken.burn(_holder, _amount);
        // Additional logic after burning...
    }
}

Notes

- This contract is a basic implementation and may need additional features and security enhancements for production use.
- Always ensure to thoroughly test and audit smart contracts before deploying them in a production environment.
